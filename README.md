# Marcomms-Polyglots
This is to help map items relating to supporting marketing of the polyglots team and translation day events.

Update from testing feedback and through WPTD 2021. This repository may be not needed and areas of work could be put into rolling content and features with polyglots tag. @vimes1984 - please can you action this. Thank you

2021/13/10 Update from Abha:
- items have been moved to Rolling Tasks repository (eg annual polyglots survey and polyglots monthly newsletter) and WPTranslationDay items moved to Series repository
- label for 'translation' created for tasks relating to polyglots
- this Marcomms-Polyglots repository will be temporarily archived in case it is needed in the future
